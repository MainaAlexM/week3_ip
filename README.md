Week 3 Independent Project on HTML, CSS and JavaScript
## Contents
This project entails an online-graded test for my Gwiji school's club. A student is required to take the quiz on JavaScript Course Completion to weigh their understanding of the course.
This is just a simple model made in simple languages (html, css and javaScript).
## Usage
Anyone with the link to the website can take the quiz and submit for grading. The results will be displayed immediately. The link is provided in the project description above.
## Installation
Any developer is free to fork, copy or clone the code in the repository for learning or advancing the concepts in the code. Contributions on improving the code are also acceptable through my contact email on the profile.
## Purpose
I developed this quiz as a result for the love of code I have built up through the learning experiences at Moringa School. I hope you enjoy working with and manipulating the code.
